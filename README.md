# Data-Analysis-Projects

This repository contains my data analysis project for my Upwork client. The project involved analyzing a dataset of customer purchase history to identify trends and patterns. I used a variety of data analysis techniques, including statistical analysis, machine learning, and visualization. 

## Project Insights

The project resulted in a number of insights, including: 

- The most popular products are typically purchased together.
- Customers are more likely to make a purchase if they have already made a purchase in the past.

The insights from this project can be used by the client to improve their marketing and sales strategies. For example, the client can use the insights to target customers with specific products or to offer discounts to customers who have made a purchase in the past.
